# Project-1-calculator


### 
The first part of the code "def", is to define the functions of the variable. 
### 
Then, for the second component, the code asks the user to select-operation they want to do; then, type the number that corresponds to the operation.
### 
After that, the user is asked to put in the numbers they want: num1= number 1 and num2= number 2. The reason why it is float and not int is because the user might put in deciaml numbers.

### 
The conditional statements: If the user selects 1 which is addition, python will add num1+num2 and give them the results. The same applies to the other operations

#### 
Then else statmnet, if the user puts in something other than 1-4 then he/she will get invaid operator and would have to run it again


#### *How To Use It?*
