# Project-1-calculator


### 
In the code I put def first to defind the functions of the varibale. For exmaple if the user wants to add two numbers, python will convert  

### 
Then for the second part the program asks the user to choose what operation they want to do; then they type in the number that corresponds to the operation.  

### 
After that, the user is asked to put in the numbers they want: num1= number 1 and num2= number 2. The reason why it is float and not int is because the user might put in deciaml numbers.

### 
Lastly the conditional statements: If the user selects 1 which is adition, python will add num1+num2 and give them the results. The same applies to the other operations

#### 
Last but not least the else statmnet, if the user puts in some other than 1-4 then he or she will get invaid operator and would have to run it again
